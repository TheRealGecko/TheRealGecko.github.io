Ok so I've decided that a good summer project this year is to make a drone. Which IS doable like I'm not making it entirely from scratch. But I want to make the flight control system from scratch because I like suffering I guess. I'm going to post my progress in my blog so I can hold myself accountable because I WANT to get this done please. Anyways yeah lol pray this works out.
